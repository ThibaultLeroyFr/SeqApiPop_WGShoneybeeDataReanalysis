# SeqApiPop_WGShoneybeeDataReanalysis
Reanalysis of the WGS bee (SeqApiPop data) to estimate nucleotide diversity, load and infer demography

# 1/ Pipeline to obtain a complete VCF (./Pipeline2CompleteVCF)
We used the g.vcf files generated by Wragg and collaborators (2022), for details regarding these previous steps (mapping, g.vcf, etc), see https://github.com/avignal5/SeqApiPop <br>
To speed up the combination, our pipeline is run independently for each chromosome (see script_lanceur_combinevcf_chrperchr.sh, this script launches script_combinevcf_Dorsata.sh for each of the chromosomes, thanks to the information provided by on the file HAv3_1_Chromosomes.list). Note that the example provided is for the outgroup (Dorsata), but the same strategy was used for the focal species (SeqApiPop data). <br>
